    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>1 tablespoon tallow, or cooking fat of choice, separated</li>
        <li>4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round pie plate or 8×8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Lightly brown the meat in cooking fat over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed skillet or cast iron. Transfer to pie plate once cooked.</li>
        <li>Add a little more fat to the skillet and brown the onions until translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Stir frequently.</li>
        <li>While the onions cook, whisk the eggs. Add herbs, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour over the beef so it sinks into the meat. Shake the dish gently if needed.</li>
        <li>Arrange the onions in an even layer over the eggs and meat.</li>
        <li>Top the whole pie with cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the cheeseburger pie to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
        </li>
    </ol>
